[![Support me on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/martinvlcek)

C#/.NET10 reimplementation of [Kenshi](https://lofigames.com/), aiming to run original content,
mods and saves unchanged. **No game assets are shipped; an installed legal copy is required.**
Early playable slice: streamed Vulkan world, characters/animation, movement/combat/body state,
NPC population/partial AI, inventory/trade, saves and native UI. 

Remaining work: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) 
Architecture/research: [docs index](docs/README.md)
Website: [meitou.martinvlcek.sk](https://meitou.martinvlcek.sk/).

## Download and requirements

[Windows releases](https://github.com/VlcekM/MeitouClient/releases): unzip and run meitou.exe
(game) or meitou-viewer.exe (debug world viewer); prebuilt packages need no separate .NET install.
Windows10/11, Vulkan1.3 GPU with required descriptor-indexing/indirect-draw features, and Kenshi.
Other platforms are untested; optional ray-query GI falls back on unsupported GPUs.
Building requires the [.NET10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

Steam installs are located automatically; otherwise select the Kenshi folder when prompted,
set KENSHI_PATH, or create git-ignored meitou.local.json in the repo/working/executable directory:

```json
{ "kenshiPath": "<your Kenshi install directory>" }
```

## Build and run

```text
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet test -c Release --filter "Category!=Slow&Category!=Bench"
dotnet run -c Release --project src/Meitou.Game -- --new-game
dotnet run -c Release --project tools/Meitou.ModelViewer -- --world --town "The Hub"
dotnet run -c Release --project tools/Meitou.Tools
```

For live UI iteration, run `dotnet watch --project src/Meitou.Game -c Debug -- --ui meitou --windowed`.
Saving supported C# edits updates the running game; Ctrl+R in the watch terminal restarts it.
Startup code, static initializers and already-baked UI textures need a restart to show changes.
DLSS also needs the vendor libraries beside the Debug executable, or `MEITOU_STREAMLINE_PATH`
pointing to their directory; see [third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

Run the full suite before committing. Slow tests require assets/GPU/long runs; Bench tests assert
timing and need a quiet machine. Game/viewer share the rendering and data libraries. Use
--help / viewer --world --help for options. Tab opens settings, F10 lists current keys, F11/F12
show statistics/profiler. Game F5 saves/F9 loads; F2..F4 select1/2/5 speed, Space pauses,
F6 cinematic camera, F7 hides UI. [Viewer guide](docs/viewer.md), [simulation](docs/simulation.md),
[UI compatibility](docs/faithful-ui-parity.md).

Faithful follows original rendering/UI where implemented; independently selectable Meitou
features improve quality/ranges. FSR/DLSS vendor files are runtime/packaging dependencies,
never committed. [Third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
Both UI modes currently use the original in-game HUD and windows; Meitou retains its custom
title screen, transitions and settings. Known fidelity gaps: [UI compatibility](docs/faithful-ui-parity.md).
