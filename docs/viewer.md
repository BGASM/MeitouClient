# World viewer

`tools/Meitou.ModelViewer` → meitou-viewer. Current modes: --world and --impostor-preview.
Mesh/character preview commands are retired; [character reference](character-viewer.md) retains
checks. Full option authority: --world --help, WorldOptions; toggles: AbToggles/Enhancements.

## Running

```text
dotnet run -c Release --project tools/Meitou.ModelViewer -- --world --town "The Hub"
meitou-viewer --world --zone 44,23 --radius 1.5 --screenshot out.png
meitou-viewer --view swamp --bench-frames 600 --bench-out run.json
meitou-viewer --impostor-preview <FOLIAGE_MESH>
```

Find install through KENSHI_PATH/meitou.local.json/Steam; asset lookup/load order is documented
in [overview](formats/overview.md). Never substitute a guessed absolute game path.
--at x,z / --zone / --town selects focus; --radius zones controls source height region, with
power-of-two sample step keeping<=2048 cells/side. World renderers/streaming are shared with game.

## Options and modes

Explicit later options override named-view/--low-end presets. Meitou versus --faithful <feature|all>
selects independent improvements; --meitou/--faithful overrides persisted switches. Tab controls
quality/ranges/time/weather/fullscreen/VSync. Resolution/scale/upscaler, texture-quality/mips and
anisotropy are separate controls. --weather auto schedules from day/time/seed; a name forces it.
--clouds overrides density, --no-particles disables effects; --no-gi avoids ray-query setup.

Meitou defaults: object distance20000 (Faithful12000), landmarks7.5x object range (Faithful0),
terrain material distance30000, error16 rendered pixels (Faithful10), haze250000/far450000.
Water reflection0..4 determines included classes. Texture quality0..4 skips mips; default0.
--low-end: objects/landmarks5000, quarter LOD distance, short foliage/10%grass/particles,
quarter particles, no reflection/shadows/AO/AA, flat water, scale0.83, anisotropy1, textureLow3,
material distance15000, VSync off. It is a tunable preset, not an automatic hardware guarantee.

## Keys

F10 key list is the current authority; F11 stats,F12 profiler,Tab settings,Alt+Enter fullscreen.
F11 includes the opaque UI coverage: the share of the screen under fully opaque controls (solid
backgrounds, alpha-255 atlas slices at alpha 1; `UiPainter.OpaqueCoverage`), overlaps counted once.
Panel skins have ragged translucent borders around a solid middle, so a slice counts as its largest
all-255 rectangle (inset 1 texel for bilinear), stretched to the control;
0 with the UI hidden. It bounds what a UI depth stamp could skip.
Viewer F1 switches all Faithful/Meitou; feature shortcuts use viewer bindings. Game keeps
Space pause,F2..F4 speeds,F5 save,F9 load,F6 cinema,F7 hideUI, Ctrl+F9 FPS and Shift+F11 navmesh view ([pathfinding](game/pathfinding.md#meitou-debug-view)). Do not copy viewer
feature F-keys over game actions. F8/PrintScreen game screenshots; offscreen --screenshot is
headless and settles streaming. User and cinematic bindings are separate.

## Cinematic camera

Cinema/CameraPath stores viewer keys in %LOCALAPPDATA%/Meitou/viewer-shots.json; game keys separate.
Ctrl+numpad1..9 saves; numpad1..9 cuts. Enter play/stop,0 loop,+/- timing*1.25,/ time-follow,
. list,Ctrl+. delete (editor Delete-all requires second click3s). PageUp/Down FOV±2.5deg,
10..100,Home50 (viewer and --duel; elsewhere in the game PageUp/Down are floor_up/down).
F6 editor supports scrub/retime0.05s/reorder/ease, add/update/delete and recording.
Keys include eye,yaw,pitch,log-distance,lens,hour; Hermite time spline unwraps yaw/hour, stops
at easing/open endpoints and joins loops. Unequal timing can overshoot; use easing where needed.
Record-path samples manual flight each second plus endpoints. Numpad* letterbox2.39:1/clean view.
Shift+Enter records numbered PNGs to C:/Temp/meitou-take-<time>, fixed1/60s camera/world motion;
render duration does not alter film time. Recording excludes UI/editor and uses an open flight.

## Diagnostics and references

[Benchmark](bench.md), [renderer](renderer-native.md), [simulation](simulation.md), render-* feature
references and [docs index](README.md). Establish two identical baseline renders before judging
pixel differences; temporal upscalers and evolving particles have noise. Profiler separates CPU
recording/GPU/pre-frame/streaming, not serialized sums. --log-spikes helps diagnose tails.
**Verified screenshot conventions:** right-handed/Y-up, counter-clockwise fronts, textures as
stored; human~19.5 units and katana12.8. Unit/placement formulas have their own research scopes.
