# Input and controls

Original OIS/GUI/action dispatch research, controls.cfg and exe byte/name-table checks. Source
scopes/action tables below. Meitou `InputState`/`InputBindings` consume presses once per control
tick; host picking/UI issue commands, not direct simulation mutation. [Simulation](../simulation.md#player).

## Binding encoding

**Verified** code=scancode | Shift0x100 | Ctrl0x200 | Alt0x400. Low-byte OIS scancode; left/right
modifiers share bits. Low-byte0 mouse=(buttonIndex+1)*4096 (Mouse1/2/3=0x1000/2000/3000).
Name formatter prefixes Ctrl+Alt+Shift, unnamed Key_n, mouse Mouse_n. Key names are a256-entry
exe table;111 null. Preserve scancode semantics rather than substituting ASCII key codes.
Controls.cfg first line version1, repeated action=KeyName entries allow multiple bindings.
Missing/empty file writes defaults; version<1 treats changed camera/floor/build bindings specially
(exact application partly Observed). Default-unbound and UI-unrebindable actions remain in tables.

## Dispatch and selection

Window/OIS state, modifier composition, binding lookup, action event and GUI/pointer mode are
separate stages. UI consumption/pause/loading/editor state can block commands. Press/release,
held movement, click/drag, double-click, floor/camera and context verbs have separate handlers;
do not trigger game actions solely from a matching key. Selection ownership and inspection differ:
inspecting non-player characters updates panels without giving orders to them. Context menus
choose verbs based on target type/state, faction, carrying and available interaction.

Original strategy camera actions/zoom flags are in [camera](../formats/camera.md). Engine defaults:
Space pause,F2/F3/F4=1/2/5,F5 save,F9 load,Tab settings; current complete keys in [viewer](../viewer.md)
and [engine](../engine.md). User bindings and viewer/cinematic bindings have separate lifetimes.
Settings-tab labels/type/ranges/restart semantics: [settings](../formats/settings.md).

### 1. Pipeline — layout/example

```
OIS keyboard/mouse -> MainListener (keyPressed/mouseMoved/mousePressed)
   -> inject into MyGUI (always)
   -> binding table (FUN_140360b30) unless a text field / key capture owns the keyboard
        -> sets held-state flags (polled by camera, selection code)
        -> appends event ids to a per-frame queue
   -> GameLoop_InputActions (FUN_140788100) drains the queue: MainBar hotkeys first, then game actions
   -> frameEnded (FUN_14082b6e0) clears the pressed flags of event actions and the queue (FUN_140360a80);
      held flags are cleared by the release handler (FUN_140360da0), which looks the released code up again
```

### 4. Action table

Binding maps: general map at Controls+0x28, build-mode map at +0x50 (checked first while mode field +0xd4 == 1,
**Observed**). Actions with `build_` prefix use context 1.

| Action | Default | Event id | Kind |

| mouse_command | Mouse2 | 0 | held |
| mouse_rotate | Left Control or Mouse3 (two alternative bindings, not a chord) | 0 | held |

### 6. Event dispatch

GameLoop_InputActions (FUN_140788100; step 4 of [game-loop.md](game-loop.md#update-threads-and-budget)) drains the queue each frame. **Observed**: it does nothing while the loading
window is visible (FUN_1406e2100 is a visibility test on the LoadingWindow, constructor 14091a280); the Esc menu
being visible (EscMenu, constructor 1409180e0) ignores every event; two further gates suppress most game
events: a byte at PlayerInterface+0x2f0 and a visibility flag of the widget at GUI+0x20 (FUN_1406e1fd0, not
identified; pause 0x12 is only blocked by the second). While the MainBar object exists every event except the
100..120 and 0x22 group first goes to the MainBar hotkeys (FUN_1407262b0):

| Event | Effect (**Observed**) |
|---|---|
| 1 | open the inventory window of the selected character (FUN_140724980 -> FUN_1406e6f10; target window inferred from the action name `toggle_inventory`) |
| 2 | open or, when already open, close the per-character window for the selection (FUN_1406e5f10; stats window inferred from `toggle_stats`) |
| 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 | request Overview tab Map / Faction / Research / Crafting (HUD field +0xd0 = 0/1/2/3) |
| 7 | toggle the visibility of one GUI window (FUN_1406e1f20; taken to be the Tutorials window, **Unknown** which) |
| any other id | forwarded to the orders panel handler FUN_1407226e0, which acts on 0x17..0x21 (orders buttons) and ignores the rest |
| 8 | not in the hotkey function: handled in the action switch by FUN_1406e2a20, which flips the GUI-hidden flag at GUI+0x330 ("toggle whole GUI") |

Meitou's first aid and rest bindings (2026-10-13, `PlayerInterface`, engine choices; simulation side in [simulation.md](../simulation.md#bodies)). The original's own: `medic` (NUM7, event 0x1f) and `rescue` (NUM8, 0x20) are
orders-panel toggles forwarded to FUN_1407226e0 (the Medic and Rescue buttons of the panel, [ui-screens.md](ui-screens.md#4-hud-mainbargui)), i.e. job switches, not targeted orders (**Observed**); the targeted order is the context menu
verb 25 "First Aid" (pointer mode 1 `med`, section 7; Meitou's context menu also provides it). The numpad belongs to the cinema camera (`Cinema`, docs/viewer.md), so:

| Input | Effect |
|---|---|
| right click on one of the player's own characters with something to bandage | the selected characters treat it (`TreatOrder`); a lone selected character on itself treats itself |
| `H` | medic job on / off for the selection (the original's `medic` toggle: idle characters with a kit treat hurt squad mates by themselves) |
| `L` | the selection rests (sits down; **no binding in the original**); any move order or `R` ends it |

| Input | Effect |
|---|---|
| Ctrl + right click on a knocked-out or dead character | the nearest selected character picks it up (`PickUpOrder`); on a body a selected character carries, puts it down (`PutDownOrder`) |
| right click on one of the player's own downed characters with nothing to bandage | picks it up (as the original's quick right click; with something to bandage it is first aid, as above) |
| Alt + right click on a knocked-out or dead character | the nearest selected character takes all that fits from its inventory and backpack (`LootOrder`; no window) |
| `J` | rescue job on / off for the selection (the original's `rescue`, NUM8) |
| `K` | the selected carriers put their bodies down |

## Unknowns

- Meaning of the listener's suspended field at +0x50 and of FUN_1409134c0 (possibly splash skip).
- What exactly the version-below-1 branch of the controls loader does with its action set.
- Identity of the widget behind FUN_1406e1fd0 (GUI+0x20) and of PlayerInterface+0x2f0, which gate most game events.
- Which window event 7 toggles (taken to be Tutorials); targets of events 1 and 2 inferred from the action names.
- Meaning of the target kinds 8 and 0x16 that shortcut the 0.2 s context-menu hold test.
- Press versus release timing of the command button, and the exact rotation marker condition.
- Conditions inside FUN_140917120 (which windows count as closable) and the meaning of the held/edge flags.
- Box select handling of non-player squads and animals.
- Whether the controls loader accepts every composed name the formatter writes (`Alt+`, `Key_<n>`) when reading
  a hand-edited file.
