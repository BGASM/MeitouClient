# AI task tables

Task names/IDs: `src/Meitou.Data/Gameplay/Ai/TaskType.cs` (all 288 named rows checked against this research). IDs 289/290 are unnamed in FCS. See [AI](ai.md) for runtime semantics; lock, door, cage and lockpicking task behaviour (76-80, 107, 110, 133, 140, 155, 162, 166/167, 185/186, 195-201, 207, 285/286) is in [locks](locks.md). Tables retain factory mappings and all TaskData/state values; repeated enum names and condition names are represented by IDs.

## taskType to Task class

**Verified** (the Tasker factory `FUN_14032ebd0` switches on a byte table at `140330408` indexed by taskType - 1; the table was read
from the exe bytes with a probe, each case body was matched to the RTTI `Task_*` class its constructor installs, and the resulting
type-to-class list agrees for all 290 rows, including 147 default cases). 290 jump-table entries versus
289 names in `fcs_enums.def`: types 289 and 290 build `Task_Follow` and `Task_BashDoor` and have no enum name (**Unknown** why).
147 types fall through to `Task_Blank` (the factory's default case): no behaviour of their own from this factory.
The per-type record census is omitted; it can be regenerated from merged AI_TASK data.

Factory mappings grouped by identical class; each ID occurs exactly once:

- (goal; Task_Blank): 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 30, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 63, 66, 70, 84, 85, 86, 88, 89, 90, 91, 94, 101, 104, 105, 106, 109, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 117, 118, 120, 122, 125, 126, 131, 132, 135, 137, 138, 139, 142, 143, 144, 145, 148, 149, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 157, 158, 160, 167, 168, 169, 172, 173, 177, 178, 179, 183, 184, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 197, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 211, 212, 214, 217, 218, 222, 223, 230, 232, 233, 234, 237, 238, 239, 242, 243, 245, 248, 250, 251, 252, 254, 255, 259, 260, 265, 268, 270, 271, 273, 275, 276, 277, 279, 281, 282, 283, 288

## Build tasks

**Verified** (factory `FUN_14032ebd0`, order labels `FUN_14079b2d0`): player orders 2 "Build", 95 "Repair" (both
`Task_Build`), 96 "Dismantle" (`Task_Dismantle`); 71 `Task_AddMaterialsToBuilding`; 247 `Task_EmptyMachine_BuildMats`.
Conditions: 50 `hasBuildingMaterials` (`FUN_14059ba50`: nothing outstanding, or the character or its backpack holds
one of an outstanding item), 51 `buildingHasBuildingMaterials` (`FUN_1405a39c0`: site not stalled), 150
`HAVE_SOME_BUILD_MATS` (`FUN_140597530`, **Observed**: inventory holds the target's item). `Task_Build`
(`FUN_14034a440`) plays `medic` (sounds `Character_Build_Loop_Start/Stop`), pushes build work each update and ends
when the building is gone, the site stalls (back to the planner) or it completes. Work, delivery, auto-job scoring and
dismantle: [buildings-production](buildings-production.md#construction-tick).

## TaskData registry

**Verified** (disassembly of the table builder `FUN_140319a60`, each registration call `FUN_14060ea00(type, memberFn, ...)` parsed,
then every row re-parsed from the decompile of the same function: 253 registration calls with 253 distinct type numbers, and type,
text, flag bits and the contents and order of lists A and B agree for all 253 rows; the decompile drops some trailing call arguments,
so the `!` on an effect and the `*` marker rest on the disassembly alone and are **Observed**). 251 of the 288 named types plus the
two unnamed types 289 and 290 are registered; 37 named types are not: 9, 10, 11, 18, 23, 27, 33, 46, 48, 49, 50, 54, 56, 63, 66, 70, 109, 111, 117,
120, 126, 145, 151, 154, 160, 178, 179, 191, 193, 205, 206, 229, 251, 252, 265, 267, 271.
Columns: display text (field +0x138), registration flag bits, condition list A (TaskData +0x4c; names prefixed `!` are required
false; `*` marks an entry whose second flag byte (+5) is set, meaning **Unknown**), condition list B (+0xa8, at most 11) and the
single effect (+0x128). What list A versus list B mean is **Unknown**: A reads like "done when" conditions (isAtLocation,
isBuildingComplete) and B like "may start when" ones (isMovementAllowed, hasWeapon) in every row seen (**Observed**). The scorer
agrees with that reading in part: it drops a candidate whose list A is satisfied (`FUN_14060f570`) and the planner takes the first
unmet state id from list B (`FUN_14060f940`), but it also drops a candidate whose B holds and that has no effect, so the roles are
not settled. The `ALWAYS_IMPOSSIBLE_TASK` row's text is the string "null". Two states (33 and 85) are registered with an empty name.

A/B/effect use StateType IDs below. `!` and `*` retain their original meanings; literal `none`/`-` remain unchanged. Unmapped or ambiguous names remain literal. Row order is registration order.

## Arrest and prison rows

Rules: [economy 11.5, 11.7](economy.md#115-bail-and-sentence). **Observed** (evaluators and TaskData hooks resolved from the exe's thunk bytes):

| Id | Semantics |
| --- | --- |
| state 129 `TARGET_IS_ARRESTED` (`FUN_14059a380`) | target `+0x2f8 == 2` (imprisoned), or carried (`+0x3d4`) by a character of another faction; a non-character target: true while I carry it |
| state 78 `TARGET_IS_IMPRISONED` (`FUN_1405a1cc0`) | the target character's `+0x2f8 == 2` |
| goal 203 Arresting | desire = AI slot 32 (`FUN_140598a40`): 0 when status `+0x88` is null and the character's ownership town is set, else 1 |
| goal 204 Bounty hunting ("Arrest bounties") | desire = AI slot 33: the free-cage finder's result; target finder `FUN_14099bfc0` (wanted, uncarried, not imprisoned) |
| goals 112 / 281 Find and put in cage | desire `FUN_1405a1140` (needs carrying); target = the best free `BF_CAGE` (`FUN_1408d0770`) |
| goal 211 Freeing prisoner | finder `FUN_1408cf3c0` (`BuildingFinder_Cages`): an occupied usable cage whose occupant's sentence is served (`FUN_1405c9f00`) |
| goal 276 Liberating prisoners | finder `FUN_1408cf140` (`BuildingFinder_CagesToLiberate`): a cage of a faction that fails the relation test `FUN_1406b2630` (read as allied) holding an occupant that is not an enemy |
| 133 / 207, 256 `Task_GetOutOfCage` | constructor flag "escape" 0 for 133, 1 for 207 and 256 ([locks](locks.md#cages-and-beds)) |

## Desire and commitment

**Observed** (TaskData constructor `FUN_14061d350`, registrations in `FUN_140319a60` parsed for all 253 rows, scorer `FUN_14050df10`, `AITaskSytem`
vfunc 5 `FUN_14050caf0`). TaskData fields: +0x108 desire (a member function, nearly always a virtual of the `AI` object: `mov rax,[rcx]; jmp [rax+slot*8]`);
+0x160 target finder (returns a factor, 0 when it found nothing; the desire is multiplied by it when the row has an effect, `FUN_14060fd80`);
+0x18 / +0x1c commitment minimum / random range in game hours; +0x20 commits; +0x34 crowd factor (default 1); +0x3c is read by the senses
(`FUN_1408529c0`, meaning **Unknown**).

- Score = desire x goal weight x crowd^n (n squad mates on the same type and target); x1.25 for the current task. For a committing current task the
  score is at least 0.4 until the commitment ends and at most 0.05 after it, so the character moves on.
- Commitment: when a committing task becomes current, end = now + min + rand x range. A candidate that is not the current task has its target cleared
  before it is chosen, so a newly chosen goal gets a fresh target from its finder.
- Desires (`AI` vtable slots): 19 = 1, 39 = 0.1 (Idleness), 40 = 0.25 (Patrolling, Patrolling town), 41 = 0.5 (Stand at node, Shopkeeper, Static guard,
  general node), 48 = 0.01 + 0.4 x rand (Wandering town, Staying home, Sitting around, Static town guard, Shopping 119). 125 rows desire 1; 102 call a
  function of their own (sleeping, following, retreating, turrets, Shopping 118: 1 until the shopping list is done).

| Type | Commitment (h) | Crowd |
|---|---|---|
| 37 Wandering town, 118 Shopping | 0.25 + r x 1.5 | 1 |
| 43 Staying home, 255 Reigning, 275 Sitting around | 0.2 + r x 0.8 | 1 |
| 38, 268 Static guard | 0.1 + r x 0.5 | 1 |
| 157 Static town guard | 0.1 + r x 1 | 1 |
| 47 general node | 0.03 + r x 0.1 | 1 |
| 153, 239 Going to bed | 2 + r x 8 | 1 |
| 190 Worker, 221 Operating machine | 0.5 + r x 2 | 1 |
| 240 Capture Target | 0.05 + r x 0.5 | 1 |
| 248 Attacking Squad | 0.3 + r x 2 | 1 |
| 45 Bodyguard | - | 0.9 |
| 57, 58, 125, 237, 250 | - | 0.8 |

## Town goals

**Observed** (target finders named; TaskData effects lead the planner to the task that acts them out):

- **37 Wandering town** (`FUN_140999a60`): keeps a target that is still a general node; else a random building of the character's town in its zone
  (`FUN_1409fc6c0` over `FUN_1409fbb00`, a building filter **Unknown**), then a random node of type 1 (NODE_GENERAL) in it whose owner is unset or the
  character's faction (`FUN_14038c2f0`); none: 0. Effect `atNode`, acted out by 51 Stand at node.
- **47 general node / 20 Shopkeeper** (`FUN_14099f280` / `FUN_14099e920`): a node of that type in the home building (owner unset or own faction),
  reserved; guard posts fall back to general nodes.
- **118 Shopping** (`FUN_1409997f0`): a shop of the town selling an item on the character's shopping list (`FUN_1409fc070`), else a random shop
  (`FUN_1409fc1b0`); factor 1 for a BF_SHOP building, 0.4 otherwise. Then 119 (`Task_Shopping`) at it.
- **214 Relaxing** (`FUN_140998d10`): the current package's own target (package vfunc 1); none: 0. Effect `IS_WORKING`, acted out by 87 Operating
  machine, i.e. using furniture there; with no free one the plan fails and another goal wins.
- **Hang-around-bar package** (`Package_HangAroundBar`, start vfunc 6): its town is the squad's home town, else the nearest friendly one
  (`FUN_1402916b0`); its bar a random one of the town's buildings of designation 3 (BD_BAR, the residents' template's `building designation`), with a
  free spot reserved there; with none it settles for something else (`FUN_140292de0`, **Unknown**).
- Building layouts' `is bar` / `is shop` are 0 on every exterior layout of the base game and mods checked (2 interior layouts set `is bar`, 9 `is shop`),
  so they do not mark bars and shops (**Verified** over the merged `interiors.level`).
- **43 Staying home** (`FUN_1408cbc00`): furniture in the home whose BuildingFunction is in mask 0x2049a (bits MINE, RESEARCH, REFINERY, TRAINING,
  CRAFTING, CHAIR; reading the mask as bits is **Observed**); **275 Sitting around** (`FUN_1408caf00`): only in the home town, furniture of mask
  0x1020080 (TRAINING, CHAIR, THRONE) not claimed by others. Both lead to 221 (pretend operating).
- Chairs (**Verified**, BUILDING_FUNCTIONALITY records of gamedata.base / rebirth.mod / the install's mods, dumped): BuildingFunction 17 BF_CHAIR
  `chair`, `chair-fixed`, `chair-fixed 180` (animation "sitting chair"; Stool, Old Stool, Bench, Sitting Box) and `sit on floor (no chair)`
  ("sitting idle"; Sitting Pillow, Sitting spot (invisible)); 24 BF_THRONE `throne chair` ("sitting chair"); all `max operators` 1. `flags`
  (0/1/2) differs between them: **Unknown** (perhaps the facing).
- **24 Wandering** (`FUN_140998040`): the nearest town; list A holds `atATown`, so it is dropped while in a town.
- **36 Patrolling town**: `Task_PatrolTown`, behaviour **Unknown**.

## Unknowns

- Why `taskType` 289 and 290 exist without an enum name (they build `Task_Follow` and `Task_BashDoor`; row 290 of the TaskData table repeats the data of `BASH_GATE`).
- What the 37 named types without a TaskData row do when an AI_TASK record uses them (the list is in the TaskData registry section), and whether any behaviour of the 147 "goal" types (factory default `Task_Blank`) lives outside this factory.
- What lists A and B of a TaskData row mean exactly, what the `*` marker on an entry (second flag byte) means, and what the registration flag bits (0x1, 0x21, 0x41, 0x55, 0x61, 0x63, 0x77, ...) select; [ai.md](ai.md#unknowns) lists the six category sets they register into.
- What the 18 StateType ids with no registration call and the two ids registered with an empty name (33 and 85) evaluate, and the semantics of most evaluators beyond their names.
- How the effect column (`!` prefix, single effect per row) is used by the planner: the planner search itself is **Unknown** ([ai.md](ai.md#packages-and-goals)).
