# Simulation

Engine contracts for `Meitou.Simulation`; game facts live in [game/](README.md#gameplay-research).
Source authority: `World*.cs`, `StandardSystems.cs` and each subsystem. Implementation choices
below do not claim original-game parity. Retain Verified/Observed/Unknown scopes in linked research.

## Time model

Control: 30 Hz real time, input/UI/camera continue while paused. Simulation: 1/30 s game time;
accumulate `realDt*speed`, speeds 0/1/2/5. Budget `6*speed` ticks per frame; excess is dropped and
`AchievedSpeed` reports slowdown. Control ticks precede simulation ticks; a speed change applies
to the entire frame. `WorldSession` rejects unequal world/clock tick lengths, owns snapshots,
clocks, input and camera, and disposes systems/services.

At player speed 0 (without a modal/loading pause), queued selection, inventory move/arrange
and open-shop buy/sell/close commands apply between ticks and republish snapshots. Other
commands stay queued; neither world ticks, game time nor simulation phases advance.

**Verified** original clock: 1200/11 seconds per game hour ([game-loop.md](game/game-loop.md)).
`BodySystem.HoursPerTick=11/36000`; medical dt units remain **Unknown**. Navmesh unload uses
real time (30 s); population unload grace uses game time (towns 60 s, roaming 10 s).
`RequestedPause` is independent of remembered nonzero speed. Render previous/current states
with simulation alpha; camera uses control alpha. Positions are float world coordinates;
rendering is camera-relative.

## Threading

Tick order: Inputs → Schedule → Think → Move → Act → ordered Apply → SlowWorld → Publish.
Inputs/Schedule/Apply/SlowWorld are serial; each implemented parallel phase has a system barrier.
`CharacterHot.Previous` is read-only; a partition writes only its own `Next` slots. Spawn/remove
only in serial phases after consumers finish; generation IDs prevent stale slot references.
Combat has separate double buffers swapped at the end of its SlowWorld, not at global publish.

Effects sort by `(target,source,system,sequence)`; spatial-neighbour iteration order is fixed.
Commands apply by tick and queue order. In-tick orders use serial `World.Defer`; deferred orders
precede host orders for their due tick. No concurrent host enqueue may alter that ordering.
Randomness: stateless `Rng.Hash(seed,entityKey,purpose,counter)`; changing purpose/salt changes rolls.
Worker partitions are `threads*2`, minimum 16 slots (game 128); one worker means caller execution.
Async paths, navmesh and population results enter at tick boundaries; arrival timing is not
repeatable in play. Determinism tests use synchronous services.

`StateHash` is ordered, includes slot/generation/free-list and hashed subsystem state, normalizes
negative zero, and is a diagnostic rather than gameplay work. Golden scenarios must agree at
1/4/16 threads before pins change; pins are platform-specific. Snapshots expose living-character
identity, appearance, transform, animation, faction/squad/player/selection and body status;
selected characters also expose skills, inventory and path. Host reads double-buffered active
zones within the frame after ticks. Null appearances draw markers.

## World model

Dependencies: Core ← Data ← Simulation ← Engine ← Game; Navigation/Rendering are sibling
libraries. Characters use hot double buffers plus cold objects; squads/platoons use sorted
registries. `(slot,generation)` IDs and the free list participate in hashes. Static typed data
views are built over `GameRecord` once; missing fields use documented defaults. Population shares
factories/database/relations and lazy body/combat/item assembly. Research owns original formulas.

## Systems and their order

`StandardSystems.Build` is the single wiring authority. Ordered systems:
Population, Player, AI, Pursuit, Movement, FirstAid, Body, Carry, Construction, Combat, Animation, Ragdoll
(only with `StandardSystemOptions.Ragdolls`), Feed, Retaliation, Aggro, Flee, Crime, Arrest, Locks, Trade (Arrest and
Locks come with the Crime part). Tests selecting subsets retain this relative order.
Population spawns before later SlowWorld work; player selection precedes movement orders;
AI writes tasks before movement; pursuit schedules paths before movement answers them.
First aid reads patients in its own Act barrier and applies treatment during serial commit.
Body handles medical ticks before combat (`TickMedical=false`); carry sees knockouts before
combat and drops carried targets before attacking. Combat swaps before animation/retaliation;
crime sees deeds and final positions/carry links. Game combat uses `SelfApproach=false`.

## Population

`PopulationSystem`, `SquadFactory`, `CharacterAssembly`, `GeneratedAppearances`: activate zones
around focus, gate spawning on navmesh readiness, create residents/bar/roaming/wild/nest squads,
and assemble race appearance, gear, stats and bodies. Counts, roles, offsets, caps, spawn weights
and world-state gating follow [population research](game/factions-squads-towns.md).
Missing references become `SquadPlan.Problems`; world states initially false are an engine
choice, not a verified original default. Residents are housed by the original's building rules with housemates and
default residents ([town residents](game/factions-squads-towns.md#town-residents)); prisoners/cages and unique replacements
remain incomplete. `ActiveZones` is double-buffered. Zone loading/spawn planning stays off the
simulation thread; publish results at boundaries.
`World.PreparePopulation` queues nearby residents/wild squads, activates existing nearby roaming
platoons and drains completed builds during loading. It publishes matching snapshots without advancing
ticks, game hours, AI, movement or roaming timers; readiness includes navmesh-gated sites.

## Player

`PlayerSystem` / Orders: selection, stop, move/queued move, attack, treat/rest/medic, carry/rescue,
loot, stances and squad toggles are commands. Resolve empty-ID orders against current selection.
New-game start data seeds squad/appearance/gear/money; the start's characters are then remade in the
character editor while `PlayerState.InCreation` ([characters](characters.md#character-editor)); original start
relation/research semantics remain partly unknown. Picking/HUD are host responsibilities, never simulation input.

### Order toggles

Passive/Hold/Block/Taunt/Jobs/medic/rescue state belongs to the player/character and relevant
systems. Explicit player commands and automatic retaliation have different eligibility;
Idle players self-defend unless Passive, and Hold prevents pursuit beyond attack reach.
New player characters start with Jobs and Ranged enabled. Jobs gates automatic medic/rescue
work; direct orders still run. Saved toggles override defaults, including explicit false values.
Jobs uses the Meitou-only bool `meitou jobs enabled`; the original save key is **Unknown**.
Sneak: sneaking speed cap and clips, quieter, smaller view factor; a hostile looker sees the sneaker only once its
spot meter fills ([perception](game/perception.md#spotting-a-sneaker)); the exposure feeds stealth XP.
Ranged (tooltip, **Verified** in `main.pot`, mainbar.cpp:1279: "prioritise ranged attacks, melee will be a last resort"): a
crossbow carrier takes the crossbow at any distance and melees only when dry or a melee attacker is on it; off, the distance
rule of `ChooseMode` applies. Taunt (mainbar.cpp:1273: "draw more of the enemy to attack him"): a hostile looker picking a
new fight prefers a visible taunter over any non-taunter (nearest first); its squad joins as usual. Fights already under way
are not retargeted; a sneaking taunter does not count. Both rules are engine choices; the original's are **Unknown**.
New games select the squad's first member. The game host also selects the first member after
loading, before publishing the initial snapshot; the save reader itself retains saved selection.

## Movement and paths

`MovementSystem`, `PursuitSystem`, `IAgentWalkability`: schedule/query asynchronously, publish at
boundaries, follow ordered path points, steer/separate using previous state and project to ground.
New move orders preserve reusable paths; attack pursuit reschedules target paths. Turning can
hold translation while facing changes. Original speeds/encumbrance and research are in
[pathfinding.md](game/pathfinding.md); footprint clearance/water costs come from nav queries.
Heights use the character's (or clicked) Y to pick stacked floors; long paths have a provisional tail.

## Navmesh

Own DotRecast builder/cache (`Meitou.Navigation`), not Havok runtime. Default cells 2, height 1,
48-cell tiles, agent height 18/max climb 5; ground/water/door areas. A* checks portal clearance
`2*radius` (default radius 4), water factor and doors. `NavAdapter` exposes simulation interfaces;
`ZoneGate` holds population until ready. Collision and world placement rules:
[collision.md](formats/collision.md), [pathfinding.md](game/pathfinding.md).
Cache validation, asynchronous unload races and key omissions are listed under known gaps.

## Animation

`AnimationSystem` produces named layers/weights/times; `AnimationLibrary` supplies race clips,
lengths, masks and selection data. Movement, held care/lying clips, melee/ranged actions and hit
reactions use researched animation rules. Root motion advances with clip time; relocation keeps
separation by footprint radii and drops blocked components. Rendering consumes snapshot layers;
shape/skinning belongs to the character renderer. [animation.md](animation.md).

## Bodies

`BodySystem` / `FirstAidSystem`, `Meitou.Data.Gameplay.Bodies`: race/stat/part factories,
medical tick, blood/hunger/parts, knockout/death, healing, limb state, move speed/encumbrance and
moving XP. Combat hits use the same body state; avoid double medical ticks. Treat/rest/medic
orders find eligible still patients, walk to reach and apply aid serially. Medical time scale
is explicit and uncertain; [character-stats.md](game/character-stats.md) owns original rules.

## Items and eating

`Inventory`, `ItemFactory`, `FeedSystem`: grids, stack limits, backpacks, quantities/charges,
load and food provision. ITEM `stackable` is an integer, not boolean; gear stacks cap at one.
Transfer/split/top-up through inventory APIs. Food/auto-eat uncertainty and container bonuses:
[character-stats.md](game/character-stats.md), [economy.md](game/economy.md).

Inventory moves validate snapshot identity, bounds, occupancy, stack limits and equipment
type/armour slot. Weapon sections are 10×2 (back) and 7×1 (hip); other equipment slots hold
one compatible item. These are engine constraints, not a complete original-game rule set.
Backpacks move intact between pockets and their attachment slot; containers cannot be put
inside a backpack. Equipment moves refresh worn appearance and combat gear; pocket armour
does not grant worn bonuses. Race restrictions, swaps and prosthetic changes remain absent.

## Combat

`CombatSystem`, `CombatDatabase`, `Fighter`: attack scheduling, equipment/techniques, stance,
block/dodge, armour and per-part damage, stun/KO/death, combat XP. Read previous combat state;
ordered effects apply hits. `TickMedical=false` with BodySystem, `SelfApproach=false` with pursuit.
Original formulas, constants and unresolved technique terms: [combat.md](game/combat.md).
Hits, pauses and initiative follow combat.md "Hit reactions" / "Pacing"; the combat system picks the stumble
clip (through the animation system's chooser) and holds the fighter for its length. Engine choices: a miss waits
0.2 s; the first attack after an order waits 0.15–0.6 s; the initiative roll is drawn per pair and tick so both
sides agree, and the loser holds off for 1 s; a target that would not swing back (stumbling, defending, not fighting, Block or
Passive order) is simply attacked; one that lost the roll to a fighter becomes its target; a defence that starts late
joins its clip partway so the passed roll counts when "Late dodges and blocks" is on (Advanced setting, a balance
change: Faithful off, Meitou on);
attack slots go to the nearest fighters at the target (Advanced setting "Attackers per target", 1-5: Faithful 1,
the CONSTANTS value; Meitou 3), the rest wait instead of circling; the block break-out ignores the 10% lower bound; only a heavy bolt staggers.

### Ranged

Crossbow reload/steady aim, skill spread, bolt flight, ammo, obstruction and friendly hits are
simulation state; `Schedule` advances bolts. Targets without medical bodies do not stop bolts.
Ranged state is hashed when used. Weapon/turret research: [combat.md](game/combat.md).

### Animals

`ANIMAL_CHARACTER`, animal body/stats/size/fists and creature techniques come from typed data;
animals use faction hostility and carrying/damage rules where eligible. Unarmed humans use
martial-arts category 5. [animals.md](game/animals.md), [characters.md](characters.md).

### Hostility and relations

`AggroSystem`, `RetaliationSystem`, `FleeSystem`: previous-position sight/hearing, faction
relations, shared targets, idle-player self-defence, pursuit leash and return to routine.
Orders defer to the next tick. Relations are live state and deed/witness effects have distinct
paths; preserve current ordering. Original threshold/sense/retreat facts:
[perception.md](game/perception.md), [AI](game/ai.md), [factions](game/factions-squads-towns.md).

## Carrying, rescue and looting

`CarrySystem`: serial links, pickup/put-down, dropping on KO/death/attack, rescue jobs and inventory
looting. Carried bodies follow the carrier and affect load. Loot can raise witnessed theft and
stolen ownership marks. [carry-loot.md](game/carry-loot.md). It also runs the stealth knock-out
(`StealthKo` task, reusing `CarryTarget`/`LiftTime`): [combat](game/combat.md#stealth-knock-out).

## Ragdolls

`Ragdolls/RagdollSystem` (game behaviour: [ragdolls](game/ragdolls.md)) runs serially after animation
when the host passes `CharacterRigs` (the game does; tests and goldens do not). Engine choices:
- **Physics**: BepuPhysics2, one scene stepped on the calling thread (deterministic, 2 solver
  iterations, 4 substeps per tick). Bodies and joints come from the race's ragdoll `.phs`
  (`RagdollDefinition`, scaled by the animal size); revolute → hinge + twist limit, spherical →
  ball socket + swing + twist limits, fixed → weld. Joined pairs do not collide.
- **Parts**: `Whole` when incapacitated, `CarryMode` when carried, a human's downed limbs by their
  LOCATIONAL_DAMAGE `collapse part` (not robotic ones). Bodies outside the mask are kinematic, driven
  by velocity to the animated pose. Animation holds its layers while the whole body is a ragdoll.
- **Published pose**: `CharacterSnapshot.Ragdoll` (model-space `BonePose` overrides, weight for the
  get-up blend); the renderer poses with it. While `Whole`, the character's position follows the root.
- **Scene**: 32-unit tiles round each moving ragdoll, terrain sampled every 2 units, plus building
  collision from `Meitou.Navigation.RagdollGeometry` (per zone on a worker, doors and passable parts
  skipped, ≤16 zones). A tile has ground only until its zones are gathered. Tiles unused for 90 ticks go.
- **Hash**: mask, frozen, age, blend and body poses in system order.

Gaps: no ragdoll state in saves (a loaded downed character's ragdoll starts from the lying clip);
ragdolls collide with each other but not with characters that have none; the building gather's
timing can change a live game's hash (goldens have no environment).

## Crimes and bounties

`CrimeSystem`: pending deeds, witnesses, booking, police eligibility, faction ledgers and expiry.
Carry/combat report deeds; serial sweep observes current positions. Bounty expiry uses
`0.04 hours/cat`, permanent at >=10000. Original categories, witness rules, imprisonment and
remaining uncertainties: [economy.md](game/economy.md). Expiry is paused while imprisoned. The police's response:
[Arrest and jail](#arrest-and-jail).

## Cages, beds and locks

`Locks/`: `World.Fixtures` (`FixtureRegistry`) holds every door, `has lock` container, cage (function 8, pole/peeler
`Restrains`) and bed of a town, registered once when the population first spawns the town (`RegisterSite`), kept on
unload, hashed only once non-empty. Facts: [locks](game/locks.md), [economy 11.5/11.7](game/economy.md#115-bail-and-sentence).
- **Ids** (engine): a building's own lock = its instance id; door i `<inst>#i`; interior item `<inst>/<layout index>`
  (`TownBuildings` collects them as `TownFixture`s); bed k `<inst>@bed<k>`. Owner: the placement's `owner faction ID`, else
  the town's faction. Lock levels roll from `Rng.Hash(seed, StableHash(id), Lock, 0)`: load order never changes them.
- **Doors**: `AiSystem` applies the template's `initial door state` when it assigns a home (first squad, not to restored
  doors). `IDoorGate` (the game's `NavAdapter` -> `NavDoors`, reset on `ReplaceWorld`) closes a building for every path while
  all its doors are effectively locked and none broken (engine: one nav door state per building; closed-unlocked doors stay passable).
- **Cages/beds**: `FindCage` (original weights; engine: skips a cage the carrier can't reach, `Reachable`: its building
  shut by another faction's doors, or a walk of that faction there failed in the last 24 game hours, `MarkUnreachable`;
  no path query runs in a tick), `Imprison` (state 2, `CharacterTable.Place` at the item's origin, cage
  locked, sentence; optional carrier; every caging is in `CagingsOf(tick)` and the `Caged` event, the bounty-claim hook),
  `LiftOut` (a `PickUpOrder` on the occupant of an unlocked cage, awake or down, engine; out of another faction's cage
  the lifter gets a pending code 7 and the freed one Escaping Prison + `Escaped`), `Release` (unlock, clear, erase the releaser's and jail's bounty entries for a booking releaser),
  `GetOut` (refused while locked; Escaping Prison unless served), `EnterBed`/`LeaveBed` (a move order gets a sleeper up).
  `CharacterCold.InSomething`/`InWhat` name the fixture; an imprisoned character is skipped by AI, movement (held still),
  aggro, answering, `CombatSystem.Engage` as attacker (it can still be attacked) and carrying. Sentence: `SentenceStart`
  (`World.GameHours`) + `SentenceLength`; served when start + length <= now; no bounty with the cage owner: none (served).
- **Lockpicking** (`Lockpicking`, serial; the player's order is in [Arrest and jail](#arrest-and-jail)): `Step` per task update (pending crime,
  timer on the lock, seeded roll by the lock's roll counter, XP), `Allowed` (min chance; engine: conscious, an arm, not
  carried, not on a pole), `Break` (strength > 3 x hardness). Not built: shackles (item locks), cutting, door motion.

## Arrest and jail

`Crime/ArrestSystem` (serial `SlowWorld`, after `CrimeSystem`) and `Locks/LockSystem`. Facts: [economy 11.5, 11.7, 11.8](game/economy.md#117-arrest).
Arrests, the recognition meter and the marker are hashed only while set. What a save keeps of them: [Saves](#saves).
- **Triggers**: a police-like witness that books a crime acts at once (`CrimeSystem.BookingsOf`, the witnessed-crime
  events); every 15 ticks an awake NPC within 400 that sees a player character (`Visibility`/`SneakVisibility`) whose
  bounty with its faction reaches its class threshold spots it, at once while `RecentlyWanted` > 0 (250 game seconds after
  a booking or a witnessed crime; engine: the countdown), else after 45 s of being seen (engine: one meter per target,
  rate not decoded); only the nearest free police-like looker acts. MILITARY threshold: engine 2000 (original 4000 or 2000);
  the police-like NPCs of the five towns `CrimeInstallTests` loads are MILITARY (**Observed**), so there a fine comes only from a booking.
  A police-like NPC in its own town arrests an escaped prisoner (`CharacterCold.Escaped`) it sees. `AggroSystem` no longer
  attacks wanted characters.
- **Fine or arrest** (engine stands in for the dialogue): outside his town (engine: farther than 2 x his resident squad's
  home radius from its centre) the guard and his free squad mates attack. In it, 1..1049 is fined (`FineFor`; 300 up to 250
  is engine, the data's line being unreachable): he walks up
  (`Engaged`, so the AI leaves him alone), and within 40 takes the fine when the player's money is above it, erasing his
  faction's entry; else, when the target runs past 800 or after 60 s, and for any bigger bounty: arrest.
- **Arrest**: attack until the target is down (combat ends the fight; nobody beats a downed target), lift
  (`CarrySystem.BeginPickUp`), `FindCage` from the guard (his squad's home building; other arrests' cages reserved), walk,
  and within `use range` + 15 (or a walk that ended within 200) `LetGo` + `Imprison` (`prison time` CONSTANTS). The fight
  stopping with the target up re-orders it within 800, else he gives up; no free cage: he drops the captive (engine).
- **Release**: player and NPC prisoners alike are freed by the release rounds below.
- **Rounds** (`LockSystem.Rounds.cs`, serial; a sweep every 30 ticks starts at most 4, at most 8 run; the worker is
  `Engaged`; each lock takes the owner's 3.3 s): **release** (211): an awake prisoner whose sentence is served, in a cage of
  a faction that books bounties, is freed by an NPC of that faction (one with goal 211 in its role list and hours first,
  else police-like, nearest within 1500) who walks there, unlocks and `Release`s in its faction's name; engine: none such,
  3 failed walks or 120 s, and the system frees it; cages of non-booking factions free nobody. **Lock-up** (155, 197): while
  a member has the goal in its hours a free member with it locks every door of the home (155 only with every member
  inside, engine: within the home's farthest node + 10; neither with a stranger inside); when no member's goal is in its
  hours, what a round locked is unlocked (engine: the morning unlock is not traced; a loaded night's locked homes come back flagged, `meitou house locked`). **Wardens**
  (195): occupied unlocked cages of the faction in its town are locked. **Keys** (engine): a worker whose target is behind
  its own faction's or home's shut doors unlocks them standing before it walks (the sim doesn't know door positions); an
  arrest's guard walking to such a cage has them opened at once. Rounds and locked homes are hashed only while any exist.
- **Lock orders** (`LockSystem`, context-menu verbs on a caged character): `PickLockOrder` (the prisoner its own cage, a mate
  walks to it; `Lockpicking.Step` each tick in reach, messages "Pick success!"/"Pick failed"), `GetOutOrder` (refused while
  locked; an unserved sentence books a pending Escaping Prison and sets `Escaped`, as does any cage of a lawless owner).
  `Imprison`/`Release` clear `Escaped`.
- **HUD**: `CharacterSnapshot.Prison`; the State line shows the status panel's prison text.
- **Bail** (`PayBailOrder`, verb "Pay bail (c.N)" on a caged character; engine stands in for the bounty desk dialogue): offered
  while the cage's owner is neither the player's faction nor lawless; price `BailFor` (11.5); paid when a free, awake player
  character is within 500 of the cage and the money suffices (a zero bail frees at once): erases the jail's entry, `Release`
  (no escape). Works for NPC prisoners too (only freed, not recruited).
- **Put in Cage / claim** (`PutInCageOrder`, verb on a body a selected character carries; engine): the carrier walks to the
  best free cage within 1500 (`FindCage`; others' cages reserved), `LetGo` + `Imprison` as an arrest does, then `Claim`
  (11.4 caging tests; the slaver exception never applies): the cage owner's unclaimed entry, halved for a dead captive, is
  paid and marked claimed ("Received c.N reward."). A new order or 3 failed walks end it. The dialogue hand-over is not built.
- **Spawn bounties** (`SpawnBounties`, 11.2): rolled for new NPCs (not the player's, not sandbox spawns) under `Spawn` keyed
  by the character id, one fuzz roll for all its factions; no `bounty factions` -> "the empire" (fcs.def), engine: the
  faction named United Cities. Inspecting an NPC shows its bounty in the HUD's bounty panel.
- **Bounty hunters** (engine identification: NPCs of an ADVENTURER faction with a `legal system`, in the base data exactly
  Bounty Hunters): in the spotting sweep they see the player's entry for their faction's booking faction (`legal system`,
  `CrimeFactions.BookingOf`); above 4000 and once recognised (the same meter) the nearest free one and his squad attack
  (`Engaged`), re-ordered while the target is up and within 3000. When it is down, carried, caged or out of reach the hunt
  ends: no cage (11.8), and that hunter leaves that target alone for 600 game seconds (engine). Hunts and cagings are
  hashed only while any exist; restarted after a load ([Saves](#saves)).
- Not built: slaves, shackles, jailed NPCs from spawn data (template `prisoners`, `SquadFactory`).

## Buildings

Player construction contract (Faithful UI). Facts: [construction](game/buildings-production.md#construction),
[placement](game/buildings-production.md#placement), [build menu](game/buildings-production.md#build-menu),
[build tasks](game/ai-tasks.md#build-tasks), [save keys](formats/zones.md#placement-keys). Out of scope: the
outpost behaviour beyond the record (residents, raids, renaming, the map marker), the door x3 rule,
production/power/storage, research progress, fetching from storage (task 247).

**Shared types** (stubs f4cb78c, filled by the simulation track):
- `Meitou.Data/Gameplay/Construction/BuildingBuildData.cs`: `BuildingBuildData.From/LoadAll` (build fields, material
  entries), `MaterialCost`, `Target` (sum of required), `Rate` (`build speed mult` / (1200/11)), `EstimatedHours(buildSpeed)`
  (the build window's estimate, **Verified** algebra: materials / (`build speed mult` x CONSTANTS `build speed` x option)).
- `.../ResearchGate.cs`: `StartResearch(db, start)` (the default start research, then the start-off's `research`),
  `Unlocked(db, completed)` (union of `enable buildings`, BUILDING targets only), `DefaultStartId`.
- `.../PlacementRules.cs`: `PlacementFailure` (one value per original message), `PlacementTown`,
  `TownBlock(BuildingBuildData, Vector2 at, IReadOnlyList<PlacementTown>, string playerFactionId)`, `Message(PlacementFailure)`
  (the original's texts; `InvalidFloor` is "Invalid placing floor number." because the rest of that text is not in the
  docs, `NotAvailable` is the engine's "That building is not available yet.").
- `Meitou.Simulation/Construction/ConstructionCommands.cs`: `PlannedBuilding(Record, Position, Rotation, Floor, Parent)`;
  `PlaceBuildings(Plans)` (Confirm), `BuildOrder(Characters, Site, Repair)` (orders 2/95), `DismantleOrder(Characters, Site)`
  (96), `CancelSite(Site)` (engine: only a site with nothing delivered), `PauseSite(Site, Paused)`. Sites are named by instance id.
- `.../ConstructionSnapshot.cs` + `WorldSnapshot`: `Buildings` (`BuildingSnapshot`: `Id`, `Record`, `Position` absolute,
  `Rotation`, `Floor`, `Parent`, `Owner` faction index, `Progress`/`Target` in material units, `Materials` (item,
  required, delivered), `Complete`, `Paused`, `Dismantling`), `BuildingsRevision`, `UnlockedBuildings`.

**Simulation state.** `World.Buildings` (`Construction.BuildingRegistry`, sites as `BuildSite`): player-built sites in
creation order, by id, holding the snapshot's fields plus rate, builder counter and the destroyed flags. Base-game
placements are not in it. Ids `<n>-zone<X>.<Y>-INGAME`, n from a per-zone counter (hashed) that starts above every such id
in the loaded save (generated interiors share the pattern; `Reserve(id)`). The 106 `-zoneX.Y-INGAME` ids of the level data
are not reserved by the simulation (**engine gap**, the host may call `World.Buildings.Reserve`); a collision with a base
placement is the host's to avoid. `World.Research` (`Construction.ResearchState`): completed RESEARCH ids and the
`Unlocked` set (replaced, never changed in place). A new game completes the default start research
(`ResearchGate.DefaultStartId`, [build menu](game/buildings-production.md#build-menu)) and the start-off's `research`
(`PopulationSystem.StartPlayer`); a load takes the save's. Static this milestone, not hashed.

**Outposts.** `World.Buildings.Towns` (`PlayerTown`: `Number` 1.., `Name`, `Position`, `Owner`; never removed) and
`BuildSite.Town` (a number, 0 none). `PlaceBuildings` gives each new site its town by the
[outpost rule](game/buildings-production.md#placement): the parent's; else the nearest player town within 5000 (X/Z);
else the town of the nearest player site within 2500; else a `creates player town` non-wall makes "Your Outpost" at its
position, and every player site whose nearest town (level towns and outposts) within 8000 is it moves in. After the
batch, `links together` sites still without a town take the batch's last player town, else the nearest town within 16000
of their mean, else a new outpost there; a level town of another faction leaves them without one (engine:
`BuildSite.Town` names player towns only). Hashed (towns, and `Town` when set) only once there is one.

**ConstructionSystem** (`StandardParts.Construction`, in `All`; `StandardSystemSet.Construction`) runs after Carry, before
Combat; all of it is serial. `ConstructionSettings`: `BuildingSpeed` (the option, 1), `Reach` 20, `SettleReach` 150,
`Footprint` (record -> radius, optional), `AutoEveryTicks` 15.
- `Inputs`: `PlaceBuildings` re-checks only the data half (a BUILDING, unlocked, `TownBlock`); a failing plan is dropped
  with `World.Post(Message)`. A total of 0 completes at once, so a free building is complete from the first snapshot.
  `BuildOrder` (player characters, awake, not carried or caged; a complete site is ignored, repair needs building health
  and does nothing) and `DismantleOrder` set the `CharacterTask`s `Build` / `Dismantle` and `CharacterCold.BuildSite`
  (the selection when the list is empty). Dismantling is refused with the original's texts while a site stands in the
  site ("I have to dismantle the furniture first." for interior furniture and nodes, else "I have to unmount the
  buildings first."). `CancelSite` removes an incomplete site with nothing delivered, else posts "Dismantle it to get the
  materials back."; `PauseSite` sets `Paused` (only the auto-job skips it). `PlaceBuildings`, `CancelSite` and `PauseSite`
  also apply while paused (`ApplyPausedInterfaceCommands`).
- `Schedule`: a worker walks to the site like a medic to a patient (goal = site XZ, free speed, asked again after a wait
  when the path failed). It has arrived within `Reach` + footprint of the site, or once its path has ended within
  `SettleReach` more (**Unknown**: the original's work distance; a site that is a navmesh obstacle cannot be walked
  into). Work ends when the site is gone, complete (building), the character is down, fighting, carried, carrying or caged,
  or another order replaced the task.
- `SlowWorld`: arrived workers in slot order. *Build*: a stalled site (`sum(min(delivered, required)) <= progress`) turns
  into *DeliverMaterials* if the builder carries a missing item, else the work ends (fetching, task 247, is not built);
  otherwise progress += rate x `lerp(0.3, 2, e/100)` x dt x `BuildingSpeed` x CONSTANTS `build speed` x 0.75^k, e the
  engineering stat times its injury multiplier (engine choice), dt = `TickSeconds`, k the builders that already worked
  the site this tick (the 0.75 counter resets each tick: the engine reading of the **Unknown** reset; capped at 15, above
  100 it restarts), engineering XP (`XpService.Engineering`); a rate of 0 or less completes at once; at
  `progress >= target` the site completes (`Complete`, message "Building '<name>' construction complete." for the player's
  faction). *DeliverMaterials*: the bar fills at 0.2 per second (`CharacterCold.BuildBar`); full, it hands over one unit
  of each missing type (inventory first, then backpack) and the task returns to *Build* (whether the original repeats
  deliveries before building is **Unknown**; fetching aside, the two alternate). *Dismantle*: a complete site first
  becomes incomplete with progress at most target - 1; then progress -= dt x `lerp(0.05, 4, e/100)` x 4 x rate (no option
  or constant), XP as building; at 0 the delivered materials come back and the site is removed. The `medic` clip plays
  for building and delivering, `stonemine` for dismantling (`AnimationSystem.HeldClip`).
- Refund: entry i with something delivered gives `max(1, trunc(U x delivered))`, U = m + (1 - m) x
  `Rng.Float(Rng.Hash(seed, StableHash(id), RngPurpose.Build, i))`, m = CONSTANTS `min dismantle materials percentage` /
  100. Engine (no ground items yet): the items go to the dismantler's inventory, then backpack; what does not fit is lost
  with a message. A destroyed flag (a save's; nothing sets it in play) turns a building into a ruin on the next tick
  (**Verified** rule: progress 0.4 x target, delivered floor(delivered x U[0.3, 0.5) + 0.5)).
- Auto-job (not in `AiSystem`: player characters have no AI mind): every `AutoEveryTicks` an idle, wandering or following
  player character with the Jobs order, a race and stats takes the site with the best score `max(2 (1 - d^2/9000^2),
  0.0001) / (n + 1)` (n workers on it); not complete, paused, destroyed or being dismantled, and not stalled unless the
  character carries a missing item (the original's planner cost is **Unknown**; this avoids a walk to a site it cannot
  work). It goes back to its wander or follow task afterwards.
- `BuildingsRevision` bumps on add, complete, a complete building becoming a site (dismantling started), destroyed and
  remove. `Version` (progress, delivery, pause) only rebuilds the published list.

**Hash and determinism.** `World.StateHash` adds the registry (per-zone counters, then each site's fields in creation
order, then the outposts) only once it holds a site or an outpost, like `Fixtures`; `CharacterCold.BuildSite` with its bar and resume task hashes only
when set. Existing golden hashes are unchanged while there are no sites; the `build` scenario pins one with sites.
Decisions read only world state and command order, never collision or navmesh readiness (paths stay the usual
asynchronous input).

**Host seam: snapshot diff.** The host keeps the last `BuildingsRevision` it acted on (-1 after `ReplaceWorld`) and,
when it differs, diffs `Buildings` by id: added → render overlay (and navmesh if it qualifies), removed → out of both,
newly complete → navmesh. Progress does not bump the revision; the scaffold reads `Progress/Target` each frame (rule in
[construction look](game/buildings-production.md#construction-look)). An event queue would lose changes across dropped
ticks and loads; the diff does not. Navmesh membership (engine reading of the Observed rebuild on placing):
`PathMode != 0` and (`Complete` or `BuildThreshold == 0`). After each rebuilt zone publishes, the host enqueues
`RepathCommand`.
- Overlay type: the existing `BuildingPlacement` (`StateId` null, `WorldY` = absolute Y, zone of the position).
- Rendering: `WorldObjects.AddRuntime/RemoveRuntime(BuildingPlacement)` merged into `BuildZone`. Engine choice: a loaded
  zone takes the placement incrementally (no reload); the scaffold is an approximation ([render-objects](render-objects.md#player-buildings-and-the-placement-ghost)).
- Navigation: one thread-safe overlay store shared by every `ZoneGeometryGatherer` (`NearBuildings` and `BuildingHash`
  see it, so the cache key changes), `NavSystem.AddRuntimeBuilding/RemoveRuntimeBuilding` and `RebuildZone(zone)` for
  each zone within `BuildingReach`.

**Placement validation.** Host: `Meitou.Game/Building/PlacementCheck.Evaluate(PlacementQuery) -> PlacementFailure`,
pure over the query (build data, transform, floor, queued ghosts, snapshot characters and sites, towns) and services
(heightmap, collision cache, water level). It calls `PlacementRules.TownBlock` first and returns the first failure in
the original's order. The geometric half depends on asynchronously loaded collision, so the simulation trusts it and
re-checks only the data half. Ghost controls, tilt and the unconfirmed ghost queue (Undo) are host UI state.
Implemented host-side, in the original's order: town block, site under the ghost, static building under it, interior
rule, footprint overlap with static buildings, sites and queued ghosts (convex hulls of the collision shape, SAT),
characters within 2.5 of the hull, LAND parts below the water level 98, slope (four rotated bounding-box corners, `max slope`,
`match slope` tilts fully) and normal.y < 0.2. **Not decided** (never fail, so the ghost may show valid where the original
refuses): resource/crop yield, snap nodes, usage nodes, blocked use nodes, indoor floors and ceilings, vertical margins,
the 5 deg object-surface rule. Messages: `PlacementRules.Message`, else the original's text table in `PlacementCheck`.

Build mode (B, `Kenshi_BuildWindow`, Faithful UI only): categories and groups list `WorldSnapshot.UnlockedBuildings` in
database order (the original's order is **Unknown**); the window estimates hours as materials / (`build speed mult` x 6),
rounded up (rounding **Unknown**). Left click or Space queues a valid ghost, Backspace or Undo drops the last, Confirm sends
`PlaceBuildings`; leaving build mode drops the queue. The HUD panels the window covers are hidden meanwhile. Right click
on a site with characters selected gives `BuildOrder` (held 0.2 s: menu with Build, Dismantle -> `DismantleOrder`, Cancel
Construction -> `CancelSite` while nothing is delivered); the pointer is `build` over a site.

Walls (`Building/WallLine.cs`, facts in [walls](game/buildings-production.md#walls)): a `links together` normal wall, or
a snapped tower/gate, is laid as a line: first click (or Space) starts it at the ghost, which snaps to the nearest link
point of a queued wall or player wall site; each frame `WallLine.Layout` lays bend pieces at snapped ends and the
straight run to the cursor (end snapped to a start, or an end for a backwards line), and every piece runs `Evaluate`
as a `WallPiece` (own pitch for slope; `Ignore` skips connectors, wedges and walls at a snapped joint). The next click
queues every piece as its own ghost and chains a line from the far end; right click or Backspace drops the line. Each
piece becomes its own site; `ConstructionSystem` allows a subsection when a BUILDING listing it in `wall subsections`
is unlocked. `ConstructionSystem.AttachWalls` (after placing, and at the end of `BuildingSave.Read`) gives each short,
connector or wedge without parent or children a `WallParent`: the root of the first wall site, with the same complete
flag, that has a link point within sqrt 10 of one of the piece's link points or its middle (engine choice: the middle
catches crest shorts; a normal/single root wins over a subsection root; gates never parent). Orders, builders and the
auto-job act on the root; its progress sets the children's (`min(p/target, 1) x child target`) and completes them; its
removal removes them. So an attached piece costs nothing; the link is not saved or hashed. A destroyed attached piece
just follows its wall again (original **Unknown**). **Engine gaps**: level (NPC town) walls are not snap candidates;
indoor lines (radius 25), the steep-climb straight extension, the offset clamp and the arrows are not built; the stretch
is recomputed each frame from the signed overshoot. The snapshot carries `WallParent`; picking an attached piece in the
UI picks its wall (name, verbs and Cancel's nothing-delivered check are the wall's).

**Saves.** `Saving/BuildingSave.cs` writes each site as a GAMESTATE_BUILDING (`<id>-S23`) plus its entry in the zone
file's `0-buildinglist` (keys per [zones](formats/zones.md#placement-keys)); a zone without a file gets one, the slot
list and the handle (`C` = zone container, `CS` 11111, next free `I`) follow, and player-built entries the world no
longer has (a dismantled building) are removed. The instance Y is the absolute one, as in all game-made
`-zoneX.Y-INGAME` buildings of the samples (**Observed**); a load prefers `world Y pos`. `is complete` is written
explicitly. The parent is `isInsideBuilding` plus Meitou's `meitou parent` (instance id, wins on load). On load it
reserves every `-zoneX.Y-INGAME` id of the save and reads the player faction's such buildings back, in zone and list
order (the player's start has none, base placements use other container names). `town` is the outpost's handle,
`residents` the null handle. Outposts go to `quick.save` as [town-list entries](formats/save.md#player-outposts)
(made when the save has no list); an outpost read back keeps its entry id, state and handle, a new one gets the next
town container `C` (engine choice, the original's handle allocation is **Unknown**) and a seeded `CS`; a load reads the
player faction's non-nest entries in list order and matches buildings by the handle's `C`/`CS`. The state's name
is "Town state <name>" and gives the name back; a new state is written `discovered` and `explored` (Meitou choice). `Saving/ResearchSave.cs` reads and writes the RESEARCH record's `finished<k>`
and `num finished`. Not compared with a real file that has a player-built building (the sample saves have none).
The first snapshot after a load carries every site, so the host seam needs nothing extra.

**Files.** Simulation track: `Meitou.Data/Gameplay/Construction/*`, `Meitou.Simulation/Construction/*`,
`StandardSystems.cs`, `World.cs`, `World.Interface.cs`, `WorldPublish.cs`, `Movement.cs`, `CharacterTable.cs` (cold fields),
`Rng.cs`, `PopulationSystem.Player.cs`, `AnimationSystem.cs` (held clips), `Saving/*`, `Meitou.Data/Save/SaveBuilder.cs`
(a comment). Host track:
`Meitou.Game/GameHost.Building.cs` (diff, overlays, rebuilds, repath), `PlayerInterface.Build.cs` (Kenshi_BuildWindow,
ghost, commands), `Building/PlacementCheck.cs`, `Building/BuildMenu.cs` (categories and groups from
`BuildingBuildData` and `UnlockedBuildings`), `KeyMap.cs` (build map), `PlayerInterface.ContextMenu.cs` and
`PlayerInterface.Picking.cs` (site verbs), `GameHost.Interactive.cs` (hook), `Meitou.Engine` if needed,
`Meitou.Ui/*`; `Meitou.Rendering/WorldObjects.cs`, `ObjectStreamer.cs` and the object shader plumbing;
`Meitou.Navigation/NavSystem.cs`, `NavMeshService.cs`, `ZoneGeometryGatherer*.cs`, new `NavRuntimeBuildings.cs`.

## Trade

`TradeSystem`: trader-squad stock/purse/restock, open trade, buying/selling/fencing. Charge,
quality, culture, market, forbidden/stolen factors follow [economy.md](game/economy.md).
A squad shop holds one 20 x 20 stock grid (the `Shopkeepers Backpack` size); `ArrangeStock` arranges it. Shop state is hashed; open UI trade is not world state. Building shops/production/research remain
incomplete. Transfers and money changes must succeed together.

## AI

`AiSystem`, blackboards/minds, package/task data: slot/class/time/weight selection, homes/beds/nodes,
patrol/bar/shop/sleep/retreat/contracts, combat stances and off-screen roaming jobs. Data and
TaskData semantics: [ai.md](game/ai.md), [ai-tasks.md](game/ai-tasks.md). Desire scoring is an
engine approximation where original functions are undecoded; full planner, wars, prisoners and
resident town simulation off screen are incomplete. Hash blackboards/minds/jobs when present.

## Saves

`Meitou.Data.Save` parses/writes folders; `Meitou.Simulation.Saving` maps world state. Capture
serially at a boundary, write/read on workers; `ReplaceWorld` publishes a successfully loaded
world and preserves the running world on failure. [save.md](formats/save.md) owns file keys,
handles and original saved/derived/regenerated state.

### Quicksave and quickload

F5/F9 and named save menus share mapping. Restore clock, player money/faction, relation/prosperity,
player squads, character transforms/names/roles, stats/medical parts, appearance, inventories,
bounties, bed/cage state and sentence, and registered buildings' locks and doors (into the zone files: every visited zone gets one, made from the level data when the
loaded save has none, [save.md](formats/save.md#zone-files)) and selection; the host restores and writes every region's season, weather, strength and wind ([BIOMES](formats/save.md#biomes-type-28-quicksave-weather-per-region)). NPC platoons whose `basetown` is a placed town load as their saved characters at their saved positions: town-bound ones (not travellers) are pinned to the town (no trips, AI-run, homed in the building their `homebuilding` handle names, else at the site) and the town's population counts them per template, so no duplicates spawn; travellers become roaming stand-ins made from the saved characters on activation. A platoon that unloads keeps its members' state. Meitou saves write them back and the population's own squads as new platoons with their town and home building by handle ([save.md](formats/save.md#npc-platoons-meitou-mapping)). A save's nests are the wild layout's first, and its wild platoons load as themselves bound to their nest (`hometown`) or the sector they stand in, which make only the rest; Meitou saves write the nests made so far and the wild squads the original's way, the others rolled again from the saved seed ([save.md](formats/save.md#nests-town-list)). Orders/paths, animation,
combat engagement, wound-list/pain, base-game building state beyond locks and doors (interiors, inventories: a new zone file leaves them to the original's
generation), ground items, camera/speed are not fully restored. Loaded hashes need not match captured hashes: compare carried fields and agreement
between repeated loads. QuickSaveTests checks carried fields and repeatable loading.

**Crime and jail** (keys in [save.md](formats/save.md#locks-cages-and-sentences)). Saved: bounty ledger, held state and sentence, the escaped flag, the recently-wanted
and recognition timers (player platoon characters, written only while set), the locks of interior cages and containers (an imprisoned character stays locked in), and the homes a
lock-up round locked (without the flag a loaded night's locks would never be undone). **Restarted, not saved** (engine choice; the guard, hunter, releaser and warden of each job is a
town NPC the population makes again with a new id, so a saved link would dangle): arrests (a downed target lies where it fell, is spotted again once awake, the saved markers make
that quick), cagings (the carry link is not saved: order Put in Cage again), hunts and their rest timers, release, lock-up and warden rounds (the 30-tick sweep finds
them again), the unreachable-cage memo (relearned by a failed walk), lock picking (an order), pending crimes
(seconds long, victim id unsaveable). Spawn bounties are not saved: they are rolled when the population makes an NPC, never for a loaded character.

## Sandbox

Headless simulation/debug harnesses use selected StandardParts and synchronous services for
repeatability. Sandbox omits Aggro when its scripted foe must remain idle; benchmarks must
separate simulation work, startup and rendering.

## Duel

The deterministic duel harness locates a scripted knockout, runs the pre-lap fight headless,
then replays the last 40 seconds and 4 after KO with cinematic keys. Replacing the world/clock
and resetting camera evaluation is required for repeatable recording.

## The game host

`Meitou.Game/GameHost*.cs` adapts input to commands, drives WorldSession, navmesh upkeep,
interpolated CharacterDrawList, HUD, loading/transitions and saves. It does not duplicate system
order. Renderer state lives in Rendering; snapshots are the simulation-to-host boundary.

## Open questions and known gaps

Original-game unknowns are maintained in each linked subsystem reference; do not infer parity from our determinism tests.

**Engine gaps:** remaining AI is listed in [AI](#ai); persistent town/world state, production, outposts, full UI fidelity, dynamic doors and physics remain incomplete (walls: see [Buildings](#buildings)). Save and combat limitations are listed in their subsystem sections.

**Behaviour and hash constraints.**
- No end-of-tick hook: the combat system swaps its arrays at the end of its `SlowWorld`, so the result depends on the system order
  ([Systems and their order](#systems-and-their-order)). Moving the swap would change what retaliation reads.
- The two `MedicalContext` builders (`BodySystem` and `CombatSystem.MakeContext`) agree on toughness, strength, encumbrance (the body system writes it to
  `Fighter.EncumbranceFactor`, 2026-10-13) and seed, and differ in `BodyTimeScale` (combat's is 1) and `Resting` (combat's is false). So they are equivalent only at time scale 1 and for a
  character that is not resting; with the game's `TickMedical = false` the combat one only serves hits, where neither matters.
- Combat ticks are `int` (`CombatSlot.ReadyTick`, `StunUntil`) while the world's tick is `long`.
- `ItemInstance.StolenFrom` is not included in the inventory hash. Adding it requires updating the affected carry/crime pins; pins are platform-specific.
- `BodyHash` does not cover the private `starveGrace` and `starvationKo` of `MedicalState` (nor every flag such as `BloodKo`), so a divergence
  there shows in the hash only later.
- `CharacterHot.Animation`/`AnimationTime` (the old movement layers) and the name length are still hashed; removing them moves every hash.
- `HoursPerTick` is a constant of its own, not derived from `WorldSettings.TickSeconds`.
- Navmesh: unloading a zone whose build is queued or running does nothing, so the zone comes back when the build publishes (R3); the cache key
  misses foliage, record contents, `seeds.def`, collision files, the DotRecast version and the load order (R5).
